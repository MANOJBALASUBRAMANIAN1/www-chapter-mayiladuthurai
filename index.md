Welcome!

### Call for speakers

Our goal is to make the OWASP Mayiladuthurai chapter a worldwide community of interest around defence, application security, social awareness on cyber security topics, which are primary need of people in Mayiladuthurai area. If you feel you would like to talk about a topic along these lines, please come speak at our Chapter. As many of these topics are sensitive and our meetings are open to the public, please make sure you are cleared to talk prior to making a booking, and the information is publicly consumable. Additionally, we will be seeking talks on any topic relating to application security.
